Here i will tell you how can you change router name from Router to R1 R2 or anything you want!
So first you need to open the router by clicking on it (in packet traser) then here is the code:
Router>
Router>en
Router#conf t
Enter configuration command, one line per
Router(config)# hostname R1
R1(config)#

In this you see that i changed the name from Router to R1 by using this simple command 
This operation of code is held inside the router Command line interface in packet traser
